Flexisaf-AI-DS-Project1

This repository contains Python projects developed as part of my internship application at Flexisaf. These projects demonstrate foundational programming, artificial intelligence, and data visualization skills through practical implementations.

Projects Included
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
A console-based game where the user competes against the computer, which randomly selects its move. This project highlights control flow, user input handling, and basic game logic.

Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent:
An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a Q-learning based AI opponent. The AI learns optimal strategies over time, illustrating reinforcement learning principles and state-action value updates.

Sales Data Visualization:
Two exercises using Matplotlib to analyze company sales data. The first visualizes total monthly profits with a line plot, while the second compares monthly sales of bathing soap and facewash products using subplots. These tasks emphasize data extraction, plotting, and business metric interpretation.
